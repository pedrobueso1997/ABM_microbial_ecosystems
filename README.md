In this folder, I will include some *nAgent Based Models that try to reproduce different scenarios for microbial interactions*n.

In the n*first experiment*n, I work with 2 species models in which both species interact similarily between each other. Under these circumstances, I try to analyse the consequences of modifying parameters like initial percentage of each species, secretion rates or movement rates.

In the n*second experiment*n, I work with the same models and parameter scans as the previous one. However, I introduce food scarcity or stimuli guided secretion and study their resulting effects.

In the n*third experiment*n, I work with 4 species models in which species can interact similarily or differently between each other. Under these circumstances, I try to analyse the effects of food scarcity and stimuli guided secretion on interaction predominance.
